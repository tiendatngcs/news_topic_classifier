# news_topic_classifier
The goal of this project is to predict which topic an article belongs to. We scrape training and testing data from a The New York Times News using BeautifulSoup. Data is transformed to easily digestible format. Then, the transformed data is used to train various machine learning models. Each model will be evaluated to measure their performance.

Source of news articles used to retrieve training dataset: [https://www.nytimes.com/](https://www.nytimes.com/)
